The project was intended to give a better accuracy for 
users with Parkinson¡¯s disease or users with motor impaired. 
Since it is one of the primary uses for any user, 
this interface was focused on developing a web browser on Microsoft Pixelsense tabletop. 

The device supports an advanced technology which enables to detect 
any hovering object close to the touch screen. 
One of the main characteristics of Parkinson¡¯s patients is unintended tremor, 
and it makes their finger shake when they get close to touch screen for clicking. 
So we use this specific case and technology to estimate where the user was intended to click on.

By using statistical and stochastic analysis with touch input tracking and clustering, 
this interface introduces a way to support for Parkinson¡¯s patients to give a better accuracy.
